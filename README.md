# Tipper

A submission for my solidity 101 project on [Dacade](https://dacade.org) platform.

## Description

Tipper is a solidity program that simulates real world tipping system, but running on the blockchain.
It allows for functionalities such as:

1. staffs members creating their account (a purse)
2. An admin verifying purses created
3. Customers making payment into the purse
4. Admin disabling a purse incase a staff misbehaves
5. And other interesting functionalities.

In addition, staffs can only cashout from their purse once in 30 days. This is done in order to simulate real world salary system.
